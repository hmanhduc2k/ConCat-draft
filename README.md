**TEAM NAME**: HackerCat


**APPLICATION NAME**: ConCat


**PROPOSED LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENTS**: Apollo 11 (final aim is Artemis depending on progression later on)


## AIMS:

We hope to create an assistant software for android that allow launching another application or doing various repeated tasks, through an intermediate overlaying widget on the homescreen, by swiping in different directions or interacting with the widget in a different number of ways.


## MOTIVATIONS:

We wish to create a product that is useful in every aspect of our daily life, specifically in the usage of handphone for various daily tasks or to open certain important applications.
In explaining the rationale of our application, in modern days, time has become more precious and we are becoming less patient when we perform certain actions through our phone. Especially the actions that require a large amount of time to do, actions that are repeated everyday, or actions that are tedious in many ways. These actions incude, but not limit to declaring temperature on UniVus, replying to emails and messages quicker, or setting an alarm clock every night. Most of us tend to be forgetful or grow bored with doing these tasks daily, but they are important enough to make us do them.
This prompts us an important question: What if we can find a shortcut to all these tasks? What if we can perform an action one time, then record it, then we can repeat it later on? Just like playing a Youtube Video? In that, to perform these tasks the second time onwards, the only thing we need to do is press and swipe a button on the screen that is already there?


## USERS STORIES

- Imagine an NUS student who gets tired of declaring temperature everyday and decided that he wants to spend the least time possible on it. He can simply declare the temperature one time, then record through our application. The next time he has to declare temperature on UniVus, he only needs to swipe a button upwards or downwards.
- Imagine a workman who needs to get up early at 7AM every morning to go to work, but he becomes very tired at night when he returns home and he does not have the energy to set the alarm clock. He can simply rest a bit, set the alarm clock one time on the weekend to 7AM every weekday morning, then let us do the rest for him.


## CORE FEATURES

Our assistant software will include these features and designs:
-	Normal Android Mobile App icon, setting, and front-end design
-	A button/widget with customary graphic design overlaying the user’s home screen and can be moved to different locations at the home screen. The default design of the widget should be a cat as our app is named “ConCat”.
-	Customary options on how different swiping directions of the floating widget will result in different apps being launched. We will set out a default setting with 4 cardinal directions launching 4 different applications.
-	Record-and-replay features – depending on the user’s customary choice, swiping the widget will also allow our application to perform multi-stage repeated. In doing so, we will need permission to access user’s data and other applications on the phone.


### POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS

-	Voice recognition features
-	Feedback system from the users
-	Access to email and messages and automatic reply system to communication medias.


## TIMELINE AND PLANNING

-	By May, we will finalize our plan and decide on our core features, as well as designing the front-end of the application
-	By June, we hope to implement at least 3/4 of the core features above
-	By July, we hope to finalize all core features and implement the possible extensions, while testing out the system to check for bugs.
-	By August, we hope to finalize our application, eliminate all bugs, complete the documentations, and release our app on Google Play.
